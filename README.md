# FriendFinder
If tinder helps you make the fire, then this is the newspaper when you have nothing else - it burns fast and goes quickly.

## Getting Started
To use the app go to https://warm-wave-88753.herokuapp.com/
1. Go to survey
2. Fill out the questions
3. Submit - you should get matched with a friend from the database!

If you are interested in seeing all the people in the database you can click the link at the bottom "API Friends Link" where you will see all the information. You can also click the link at the bottom "Github Repo" to see the source code for the project.
